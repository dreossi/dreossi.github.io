I am currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon A9 in Palo Alto, California.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Sanjit Seshia at the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of UC Berkeley, California.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University Joseph Fourier in Grenoble (France) and the University of Udine (Italy), working under the joint supervision of Thao Dang and Carla Piazza.
